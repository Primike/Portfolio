            Hello this is a arduino project
            It detects distances and highlights an led light
            based on the distance of an object
            This project could be expanded much further as its
            bascially a motion detector that could connect with 
            other cool gadgets.`,

            built with ruby and react. Its somewhat old but it does 
            have some cool stuff. I can probably make this much better
            if I were to redo it today.`,
